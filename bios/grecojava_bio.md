I have been developing web applications in Java, ColdFusion and PHP for the past 21 years on such projects as job boards, financial management systems, e-commerce and workflow solutions. I am a Sun Certified Java Programmer. I was self-employed contractor working on web applications for various clients, such as Charles Schwab, Williams-Sonoma, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Bricsnet. I am now employed at Wells Fargo building mobile banking solutions using Java and Android technologies.
